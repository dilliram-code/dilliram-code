- 🧠 I love exploring how data, statistics, and machine learning can solve everyday problems and drive better decisions.

- 💻 Tools of the Trade: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, SQL, and a growing love for AI and deep learning.

- 🛠️ I believe in learning by doing—projects are my favorite way to grow.

- #### 📈 Current Focus:
  
    - 🔭 I’m currently working on my portfolio to showcase the projects I have done so far.
    - Working on personal data projects involving time series, regression, classification, and visual storytelling with data. Also exploring web dashboards and polishing my personal portfolio website.

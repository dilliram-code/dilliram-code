### 📈Aspiring Data Scientist | 📚 DS Student | 👨‍🦱 Science Teacher



## 🚀 About Me  
- 📊 I'm a data science enthusiast on a journey to turn raw data into real-world insights.

- 🧠 I love exploring how data, statistics, and machine learning can solve everyday problems and drive better decisions.

- 💻 Tools of the Trade: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, SQL, and a growing love for AI and deep learning.

- 🛠️ I believe in learning by doing—projects are my favorite way to grow.

- #### 📈 Current Focus:  
    Working on personal data projects involving time series, classification, and visual storytelling with data. Also exploring web dashboards and data apps using Streamlit and Plotly.

- 🌱 Always learning something new: from algorithms to storytelling, and from Jupyter notebooks to production-ready pipelines.

- 🧩 Let’s connect and explore the world of data together!
